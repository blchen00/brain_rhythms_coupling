The raw, un-identified EEG time series data can be found at the REXCO Project website, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1237654.

The generated data (including power spectra, correlations, degrees of coupling, etc.) are accessible at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FVSCxgxRviHoy81cjlw28bZftsprl6CL?usp=sharing.
